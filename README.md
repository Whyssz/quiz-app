## Brief: [view](https://whyssz.github.io/quiz-app/)

This is a classic "Quiz" project that used the [QuizAPI](https://quizapi.io/) to get questions.

#### Features:
* `react`
* `react-router-dom 6+`
* `tailwindcss`
* `yarn`

```shall
git clone https://github.com/Whyssz/quiz-app.git
```

#### Why is it this way and not that way?
In this project I used useContext as storage, although I could have used redux toolkit/RTKquery. 
Why? It's just not needed here, the task is too simple and I decided to implement this project in a modular style to better understand how it works in large projects :}
