## Brief: [view](https://whyssz.github.io/quiz-app/)

This is a classic "Quiz" project that used the [QuizAPI](https://quizapi.io/) to get questions.

#### Features:
* `react`
* `react-router-dom 6+`
* `tailwindcss`
* `yarn`

```shall
git clone https://github.com/Whyssz/quiz-app.git
```

#### Why is it this way and not that way?
In this project I used useContext as storage, although I could have used redux toolkit/RTKquery. The answer is simple, there is not much functionality, although it would be easier to write it via redux, but I wanted to consolidate the basic knowledge, and with redux I will have the next pet, where I plan to have more functionality =}
